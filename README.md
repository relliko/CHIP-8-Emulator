# CHIP-8-Emulator
A CHIP-8 interpreter emulator written in C.
Followed high level tutorials and referenced data sheets to come up with my implementation.
Using SDL for the graphics and key inputs.

## Installation
You must have SDL2 installed to compile the files with the makefile.

## TODO
- Sprite wrapping
- Cap FPS to 60 and tie timers to it to get reasonable game speeds
- Implement beep sound
- ROM selection interface
